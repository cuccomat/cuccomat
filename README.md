I'm a Machine Learning engineer specialised in Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I recently graduated with a Master's in AI from Imperial College London. Furthermore, I'm passionate about self-driving cars and aerospace. I'm proficient in Python, C++, and ML libraries (Pytorch, Tensorflow).

### [Deep Pose Estimation for On-Orbit Servicing](https://github.com/cuccomat/Deep-Pose-Estimation)

In this project I present a new approach for estimating the 6DoF of a Launch Adapter Ring, a symmetric satellite component, with no prior knowledge of visual ambiguities such as global symmetries and occlusions. I built a **custom ResNet**, parametrising rotations with their sine and cosine, uniquely identifying the angles, avoiding misleading understanding. Experiments show that my method succeeds in achieving **real-time** predictions effectively regressing the object pose from a single RGB image. The architecture generalises on different lighting and reflectance conditions. It also manages to handle the lack of atmospheric scattering that impacts on visibility when considering greater distances. I also proposed a more robust method, learning **2D-3D dense correspondences** between object 3D points and corresponding pixels and refining the pose with a **PnP solver**. Our pose estimation methods have been trained on purely synthetic data.
